150994,1984,570221,101," As the House will recall, in 1816, following a Select Committee report, the House of Commons voted by 82 to 30 to purchase the marbles from Lord Elgin for the sum of £35,000, which is half the price that he paid for them and they have been carefully preserved in the British Museum ever since, inspiring the reintroduction of classical architecture to Victorian Britain, playing an international role in the understanding and appreciation of  antiquity, and revolutionising the fine and decorative arts in an unparalleled way, all of which the Greek Government would do well to acknowledge in their request for their return",624,6.178217822
162242,1984,1898644,99," The Government also give themselves a blank cheque to withhold any other information that they choose under clause 29(2): The Secretary of State may by order exempt from the subject access provisions, or modify those provisions in relation to, personal data of such other descriptions as may be specified in the order, being information— (a) held by government departments or local authorities or by voluntary organisations or other bodies designated by or under the order; and(b) appearing to him to be held for, or acquired in the course of, carrying out social work in relation to the data subject or other individuals",622,6.282828283
134438,1984,14529,96,"Motion made, and Question proposed,That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to Her Majesty out of the Consolidated Fund to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March 1984 for expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Security on the provision of services under the national health service in England, on other health and personal social services including certain services in relation to the United Kingdom, and on research, exports, services for the disabled and certain other services; including grants in aid and international subscriptions",618,6.4375
144275,1984,214030,99," (3) A police officer may only authorise the setting up of a road check under subsection (1) above— (a) if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person (i) whom the officer reasonably suspects of having committed a serious arrestable offence; or(ii) who is unlawfully at large is in the immediate area where the road check would be set up or (b) if he has reasonable suspicion that an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1972 has been committed or(c) if he has reasonable suspicion that the vehicle or persons in the vehicle are carrying offensive weapons, prohibited articles, illegal drugs or firearms",612,6.181818182
157357,1984,1108387,95," In their summary they say: Within the limitations of a survey based on the completion of posted questionnaries relating to events of many years before by those whose health is the subject of the survey, in the absence of any other Australian populations with whose health that of the survey population could be compared, and with the difficulties inherent in interpreting large numbers of tests of statistical significance, the analyses give no grounds for concluding that Australian personnel who participated in the UK atomic test programmes in the 1950s and 1960s suffered significant adverse health effects",611,6.431578947
